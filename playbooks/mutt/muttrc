# Explicitly start with all builtin defaults, in case some admin has customised
# the system configuration file with things we don't want.  The other option
# would be to alias mutt="mutt -n".
#
reset all

#
# Override configuration defaults where necessary, trying to stick the defaults
# as closely as possible.  All of the variable options are documented here:
#
#	http://www.mutt.org/doc/manual/#variables
#
# Generally I try to only change variables to either improve the UI look and
# feel, appearance of outgoing emails, or set defaults for ask-* options to
# avoid having to confirm certain operations each time.

# Use urlview(1) to open URLs embedded within messages.  Useful when they are
# surrounded by enclosing text.  Note the slightly awkward spacing used is to
# work around the "feature" that whitespace is significant, so a space after
# an <enter> command would be interpreted as a literal space command, i.e.
# display-message.  Putting the whitespace at the end of variables and commands
# is just eaten up normally, if a little ugly.
